scripts
=======

This repository contains the contents of my ~/bin directory where I stash most
of my shell scripts. It is probably incomplete, as each of my linux distro
installs has a different set of scripts, with only a couple shared between all
of them and some of them rewritten multiple times.

Still, here's some of them, for what it's worth!

They are a combination of Korn shell and Bash scripts. Recently, I've been
enjoying KornShell '93 for scripting-- I just wish it were a better interactive
shell!-- but some of the `ksh` scripts might still work under bash. The main
feature of `ksh` I find myself using a lot of is `typeset -Z` for zero-padding
variables (heavily used in `sortdate`).
